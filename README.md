# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented with a focus on clarity and efficiency. The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for learning and comparing different sorting techniques.

## Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent items is compared and the items are swapped if they are not in order.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, placing each new item into its proper place within the already sorted items.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- **Heap Sort**: Converts the array into a heap structure, then removes the largest element from the heap until all elements are sorted.
- **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file. Here's how to compile and run each algorithm (example for Unix-based systems):

```bash
